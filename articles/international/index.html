<p>First international experience is something everyone rememebers or hopes to achive in ones’ life time. International travelling can also cause a lot of anxiety especially amongst first time travellers. Seasoned travellers also often get surprised by situations that differs in various countries or airlines. Here is a quick checklist to consider to make your travel experience easier and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>safe.</p>
<h2 id="1-passport">1. Passport</h2>
<p>Needless to say, a passport is the <strong>most</strong> important document while travelling. without it, it is impossible for anyone to get back home. It is advisable if you have a separate wallet to keep your passport for the following<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the flight journey, passport needs to be shown multiple times. You need to keep accessing it and keeping it handy is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>easy.</li>
<li>Keeping the passport away from cash and other documents is also effective. It keeps both passport and cash safe in case of any<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>mishap.</li>
</ul>
<p>ALong with original, do carry softcopies of passport and other identification with you. This way, you don’t have to carry around your passport unless absolutely necessary and risk theft.
Remember, in case of a robery, you would be able to leave the country safely with <em>only</em> the passport. However, in case the passport is lost or stolen, you need to report at the embassy and might take days to weeks to be able to get a new<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>one. </p>
<p><img src="/articles/international/10-things-to-pack-in-international-trip-passport.gif" alt="10 things to pack in international trip - passport"></p>
<h2 id="2-communication">2. Communication</h2>
<p>Communication is the key to happiness. A trip isn’t a successful trip unless you get to post stories and show off. First thing to do reaching the airport is to get yourself a <span class="caps">SIM</span> card. Whether you are alone or in a large group, a <span class="caps">SIM</span> card with internet money is a neccesity. This helps<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>in </p>
<ul>
<li>activating internet based services like google maps, google translate<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>etc</li>
<li>Keeping in touch with people at<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>home</li>
<li>Keeping in touch with people you are travelling with and hope to not get<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>lost.</li>
<li>Keeping in touch with the locals like hotels, tour guides cabs<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>yes, international roaming is a good option too but turns out to be expensive in most cases. Also, not many locals would prefer to make an international call to your number. A sim card also makes a good<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>souvenir</p>
<p>Most airports have sim card or internet devices that sell tourists quick and easy<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Japan <span class="caps">SIM</span> card work on <span class="caps">CDMA</span> technology and <span class="caps">SIM</span> cards won’t work on your phone. In cases like this they have pocket wifi routers that you rent from the airport and return during your flight<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>back. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="3-money">3. Money</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest, money is a very cool thing to have.  How you manage your money depends on country to country. Some countries are purely digital and electronic where as certain countries still work on cash. It is important to carry certain amount of cash in foreign<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>currency.</p>
<p>Cost of living varies from country to country and so do the value of each denomination. This means that what <code>10 bill</code> buys you might be less or more of what <code>10 bill</code> of xyz<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>currency.</p>
<p>Credit cards by default have <em>international spending</em> disabled. Before flying ensure to enable the option on all your cards to be able to make an<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>withdrawal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bhutan and Nepal accept MasterCard only. Visa cards are not accepted in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">ATM</span>’s</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/articles/international/10-things-to-pack-in-international-trip-money.gif" alt="10 things to pack in international trip - money"></p>
<h2 id="4-food">4. Food</h2>
<p>Taste in food varies from person to person and region to region. You need to be mentally prepared that food you would get might not be the kind you are used to or to your liking. Items as simple as tea or coffee have complete different taste. In fact, if possible, do carry some backup with you. These includes ready-to-eat packets or snacking items. If lack of morning dose of caffeine makes you cranky, definitely carry tea/coffee bags with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>you.</p>
<p><span class="caps">IF</span> the country is in a different timezone, your body will take longer to adjust to the new timings. You might start feeling hungry at odd timings. Sometimes the iternary is so packed that you don’t get time to eat while roaming around. Having backup food is handy. If you dont think you can carry from home, do pack something from the hotel before<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>leaving. </p>
<p>Food ettiquetes vary from place to place. Some countries expect tipping while others take it as an insult. Some serve good quantity of food, while others are single serve. You need to ask around and respect the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>culture.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-have-a-certain-dietary-restriction-like-vegan-vegetarian-halal-etc">If you have a certain dietary restriction , like <em>vegan</em> , <em>vegetarian</em> ,<em>halal</em> etc</h3>
<p>it is very important that you find restaurants in your area. While booking the flight, do not forget to mention the food category you wish to be served.  Flights tend to serve the special food before they serve every one else. If you wish to be served early you can change the food category while booking the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ticket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the green and red dot on food items is very specific to India. Restaurants and packed food outside India do not have that<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>distinction. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Take nothing for granted</strong>
Ask the ingredients before ordering. Simple items like icecream and french fries can also contain<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>egg/meat. </p>

<ul>
<li>Google maps</li>
<li>Google Translate</li>
<li>Video calling apps - facetime, telegram,  whatsapp<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>etc</li>

Tired body will start losing interest soon and you would not enjoy your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>vacation. </p>
<p>While planning your trip, it is very important to let some lone time or gaps in the itinerary.  This<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>allows</p>
<ul>
<li>time for your body to relax and recharge every<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>day. </li>

</ul>
<h2 id="7-socker-converters">7. Socker converters</h2>
<p>You <span class="caps">NEED</span> to carry enough power banks and cables that support all your electronic devices. additionally, you need to carry the international socket converter that has plug outlets for asian European and American sockets.

<p>Sometimes the journey requires long connecting flights and many transfers before you reach your hotel room. Extra pair of clothing comes in handy in case you would like to change.
Is it also important to pack this extra pair in your cabin or hand baggage instead of check in luggage. Luggages are not accessible during long layovers. Sometimes in case of a mix up or error, luggages have known to not reach in the same flight. In that case, it is handy to have atlaest one extra pair of clothings and other important essentials packed in your hand<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>baggage. </p>
<h2 id="9-small-travel-sized-toiletries">9. Small travel sized<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>toiletries</h2>

<h2 id="10-travel-pillow">10. Travel pillow</h2>
<p>International flights are long and tiring. Travel pillow and eye mask give you the rest you need. Even though some international flights  used to give blankets pre corona times, it is also advisable to carry your own. It might feel bit of inconvenience but it is worth the effort. 
Additionally, even though some flights may have in-flight entertainment, do download some movies  or books on your phone and carry a pair of earphones with you as well. This will help you pass time during layovers.
