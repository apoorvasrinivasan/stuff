<p><img src="/articles/friends-whoami/rossjoeychandler.jpg" alt="Friends TV Characters - who am I?"></p>
<p>Friends is a popular American sitcom that lasted ten seasons. It is a story revolving six main characters, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Phoebe in their 20 somethings figuring through life in New York city. The sitcom gained worldwide popularity amongst all generations to the extent that the actors make about $20 Million each year in royalties even<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>today.</p>
<p>When it comes to the decade long story, fans still fight about certain plot points and situations. Same goes with the friends themselves. Each friend is known for a specific personality trait that viewers identify them with and to some extent, themselves. Even though they are put in various situations, it is quite often that the script involves around a specific trait used to magnify the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>personality.</p>
<p>Fans are often found taking the “which friend are you quiz” or labelling each other with people on the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>show. </p>
<p>example, Monica Geller is an obsessive and control freak and known for her enthusiasm for neatness . Any one who feels inclined towards cleanliness or organising their lives, feel they are <em>Monica</em>. Similarly any one who identifies themselves with being stylish and trendy relates with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Rachel.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to explore the main characters and their similarities towards our collective unconscious. Even though they are far different from each other, represent part of a self everyone possesses and how these three together make an average viewer making it relatable as a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>whole. </p>
<h2 id="jungian-archetypes">Jungian Archetypes</h2>
<p>To further understand, let’s see what Carl Jung had to say. Carl Gustav Jung(1875–1961) was a Swiss psychologist and psychiatrist who proposed the theory of the psyche. The word psyche originally meant ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ but by the turn of the 20<span class="ord">th</span> century increasingly came to refer to ‘mind’. In Jungian psychology one’s psyche can be seen as their total personality and encompasses all one’s thoughts, behaviours, feelings, and emotions.
A human psyche can majorly categories into three<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>parts</p>
<ul>
<li>Conscious mind or ego- responsible for the conscious actions thoughts feelings that people are aware<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>of</li>
<li>Personal unconscious - responsible for repressed memories and temporary forgotten<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>information</li>
<li>Collective unconscious - represents reservoir of our experiences as a species, a kind of knowledge we are all born<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>with. </li>
</ul>
<p>Collective unconscious is part of our unconscious mind that are inherited by the species in general. These are shared thoughts and experiences that we are not aware of. Jung also believed that our psyche comprised of certain unlearned powerful symbols called <strong>archetypes</strong>. The archetype has no form of its own, but it acts as an “<em>organising principle</em>“ on the things we see or do. Some major archetypes<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>are</p>
<ul>
<li>persona - the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>mask</li>
<li>shadow - the hidden<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>darkness</li>
<li>anima/animus - the male and female<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>counterparts</li>
<li>self - the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>whole</li>
</ul>
<p>To further explain this, let’s review the friends once again. The personalities of these friends are written to demonstrate different part of psyche and the conflicts between each other. Their portrayal of certain version of human perception of oneself makes each character relatable for a large and unique audience. Each character in the show loosely represents one of the major elements of our psyche. Making them relatable to the species as a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>whole</p>
<h2 id="phoebe-buffay">Phoebe Buffay</h2>
<p>Phoebe is seen as the weird and random character. She is the most unpredictable and surprises often with a hidden talent. Similar to the <strong>personal unconscious</strong>, she is known for often remembering or knowing things which were forgotten. She comes with a dark past, but the memories seem to not have any traumatic effect. Most of storyline is based on her temporary forgotten talents and skills no one knew she had. In more than one instances she also knew ‘reality’ [<em>truth about London, worst thanksgiving</em>] of events never discussed. As a masseuse and a guitarist, she too has a client-centric job and has most interaction with the real world. She is confident, extrovert and has a strong yet random personality.
<img src="/articles/friends-whoami/phoebe.gif" alt="Friends TV Characters Phoebe as personal unconscious"></p>
<h2 id="joey-and-rachel">Joey and Rachel</h2>
<p> <strong>Persona</strong> is an element of the psyche which arises for reasons of adaptation or personal convenience. It can be best described as a mask that people wear to present themselves in public or social situations. Joey is character that borderlines unrealism yet manages to be liked. In fact he is shown as an actor, who literally pretends to be others for a living.
Similarly to Joey, Rachel represents <strong>persona</strong>. She has a client-serving job catering to needs of people starting from coffee but later in fashion. She is charming, presentable manipulative and get what she wants.
Let’s see some of their personality<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>They barely work. in the first half, they are shown to have minimal paying jobs yet living off people in bigger<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>apartments. </li>
<li>They live life without responsibilities and barely any consequence of their<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>actions. </li>
<li>They eats all the time without working out while maintaining his<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>body</li>
<li>They are smooth and always lucky with the opposite sex without much<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>effort</li>
<li>They are strong, good looking and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>attractive</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the series, Joey doesn’t actually do anything wrong or shameful. the worst crime he committed is lying on his resume or throwing the woman’s prosthetic leg in fire. Both incidents having no serious consequences.
<img src="/articles/friends-whoami/joey.gif" alt="Friends TV Characters - joey as persona"></p>
<h2 id="ross-geller">Ross Geller</h2>
<p>Gellers, on the other hand, represent <strong>shadow</strong>. Shadow is the dark side of our unconscious consisting of repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. Ross, like the shadow, represents how a person might behave in real situations but are afraid to admit. Shadow is the dark side of the personality. it is instinctive, irrational and aggressive. Instead of accepting us for the negative in us, shadow tends to project these on to the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves. <br>~ Carl<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Jung</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You hate in others what you hate about yourself. Ross Geller explores all those aspects of human behaviour one might think or have done and are embarrassed to admit. This leads to Ross being disliked character in friends amongst people secretly relating to his worst<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>moments.</p>
<ul>
<li>He falls in love with the popular girl and silently struggles with it for 10<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>years</li>
<li>He is insecure and jealous. He behaves irrationally sometimes and known to let his emotions get the best of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>him.</li>
<li>He says the wrong name at his own<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>wedding.</li>
<li>He has compulsive need to correct people,  or talk down to them. Finds it hard to accept mistakes. He is a professor who dates a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>student. </li>
<li>He gets touchy about what others think of him. He even arranged his own<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>funeral.</li>
<li>He judges the women he is dating. Projects his insecurities about cheating on to them.
He is the character experienced marriage, divorce, tenure and mugging. He is parents’ favourite and is bullied by his<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to Ross, Monica, to some extent, represents the worst in people. She is competitive, loud , bossy, compulsive, controlling and vengeful. They are both shown to 
Shadow is necessary part of the psyche to avoid the person to give in to the persona and solely be motivated by others’ perception. Qualities we often cannot stand in others, we have in ourselves and wish to not see.
<img src="/articles/friends-whoami/ross.gif" alt="Friends TV Characters -ross as shadow"></p>
<h2 id="chandler">Chandler</h2>
<p>Chandler corresponds to <strong>Anima/Animus</strong> which are the contra sexual archetypes. Our society has different expectation regarding male and female and these often coincide with the sex. Jung, like others, believed that infants are born with no particular gender, in the social sense. Confiding ourselves to societal expectation of sex-based gender roles is only half the growth of our<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>potential. </p>
<p>Chandler in all corresponds to the female aspect present in the collective unconscious of men(anima) and the male aspect present in the collective unconscious of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>women(animus). </p>
<p>He, on multiple occasions, have shown as a women or enjoying feminine side.Given the sexist nature of the show, he is also been ridiculed for showing his feminine side. The women he dates, animus, display  masculine traits and are shown to be dominating, competitive, argumentative, promiscuous among others.
<img src="/articles/friends-whoami/chandler.jpeg" alt="Friends TV Characters - chandler as animus">
As the show proceeds, Chandler shows the most growth. He starts off as awkward, kiddish, lazy person. He is unhappy professionally and on multiple occasions shown to be shallow and insensitive. As the series wraps up, he becomes more comfortable with his entire self. He enters a long term relationship and fathers children. He finds his professional happiness as well as personal. He also repairs his interpersonal relationships with his mother and comes to terms with his father’s<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>sexuality.</p>
<h2 id="rachel-phoebe-and-monica">Rachel Phoebe and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Monica</h2>
<p>Rachel and Monica together make up for all the feminine archetypes. Rachel starts off as an innocent <strong>maiden</strong> damsel in distress who needs to be rescued at every step. She turns to Monica, a nurturing, caring <strong>mother</strong> who provides her with home . As the show progresses, both play <strong>lovers</strong> from time to time. Rachel embodies the innermost desires of fearlessness, passion independence as the <strong>huntress</strong> and Monica becomes a head chef signifying the duty, leadership of the <strong>queen</strong>. Phoebe is the <strong>mystic</strong><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>woman.</p>
<p>Although different from each other, each woman is unique in her femininity, possessing different temperaments, ambitions, gifts, and shortcomings. However, these archetypes helps us identify with their needs, desires and ambitions.
<img src="/articles/friends-whoami/feminine.gif" alt="Friends TV Characters - feminine archetypes"></p>
<h2 id="monica-geller">Monica Geller</h2>
<p><em>Self</em> is the deepest archetype that refers to the process of wholeness. Just as the sun is in the centre of the solar system, self makes the centre of the psyche. Monica Geller is the centre of the friends’ universe. She knew each character personally. Apart form the coffee shop, it is her big apartment, where all these unconscious and the conscious come to gather and communicate. She is the hostess and a head chef at her restaurant. She is obsessive competitive and a winner. She is natural leader.
<img src="/articles/friends-whoami/monica.gif" alt="Friends TV Characters - monica as self">
According to Jung, these collective unconscious reside in everyone collectively as a society. We can suddenly recognise certain symbols or relations without having any prior knowledge about them. they are part of our collective unconscious. They communicate with the conscious mind via dreams and complexes. The show begins with the characters discussing their dreams and have often done<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>later. </p>
<p>Complexes are feelings where behaviour arises out of control. Some examples are <em>inferiority complex</em> and <em>Oedipus complex</em> which are addressed in the show. 
<img src="/articles/friends-whoami/odepeos.jpeg" alt="Friends TV Characters - monica as self">
In conclusion, all characters represent part of our collective unconscious mind and makes them relatable to all at the same making them such a success. Together they form a complete<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>human.</p>
