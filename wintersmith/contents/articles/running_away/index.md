intro: Wonders can happen during a boring enginnering enterance exam
---



Running away from boredom... running away from monotony  
Running away in search of an adventurous journey  
Running away from alloo tikki, gol gappes n chat  
to water the mouth with vada pao and lassan chutney...  
Running away from glass and canvas  
to the endeavor the art of warli........  
to undo the change this city has brought me to  
Sometimes running away is all you can do..........:o :o  

 

 

Running away from mark sheets, that gave no gain  
Running away from the place whose memories remain  
Running away from the bitch who ripped our soul apart  
dilapidated our soul n made our life hap-hazard  
i wish i could kill her without leaving a clue...  
but running away is all i can do..:P:D;)  

 

 

MY parents who have protected me for years  
gave me all the happiness n wiped all my tears...  
I'll miss my bro... my..mom.. my..dad..  
i know u'll miss me too..., oh! am glad!  
there'l be no1 to scold.. no one to argue..  
but running away is all that i can do... :(:(  

 

 

 

not to forget those who were by my side  
the craazziest people who fight, help n guide  
we "discuss" matters for hrs n yet can't decide  
life without them is a roller coaster ride...:D  
m leaving open wounds that might not heal  
Running away from u guys was never a fair deal.. :(  

 

 

I remember the days... when i could c  
the spark in your eyes while u look at me  
your innocent smile in my presence  
n your hair sticking out like medusa's serpents  
your unwanted high attitude n your low iq  
getting away from u is most sensible thing to do.. :P :P  

 



M taking with me the memories. :)  
m taking with me the experience.:)  
what all this city has given me  
Cannot be expressed in one sentence  
m sure i'll write a miss you poem soon  
But for now running away is all i can do......
