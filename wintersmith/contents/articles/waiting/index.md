---

I’m still waiting  
For that call  
One that’ll probably  
Change it all

 

I’m still waiting  
For that rose  
Filled with love  
Or a little prose

 

I’m still waiting  
to hear that line  
that will perhaps  
make u mine

 

 

I’m still waiting  
For the invite  
If I’m ready to walk  
With you in the moon-light

 

I’m still waiting  
to be missed  
or to be noticed  
that i exist

 

I’m still waiting  
for nothing more  
but to make things  
same as before

 

I’ve been sitting here  
Waiting quietly  
Waiting for YOU  
Waiting for you to notice me....
