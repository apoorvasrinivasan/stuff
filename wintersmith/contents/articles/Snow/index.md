Every person living in the heat has once thought of planning a vacation to see  and experience snow fall. December - Early March is the peak time for snow falls in various places. Here is a short list in things to remember before planning a vacation in the snow:

## 1. Snowfall is just rain
There is romance , beauty, purity in snowfall. But at the end of the day, snow fall is just rain. Snow falls when there is precipation on a cloudy day, under very low temperature. Which means, just as rains, snow fall is sudden and depending upon the cloud sky. There are trustable weather forecasts, but they are usually right for the week. Dont trust travel agents, or last year's stats.

## 2. Snow is not wet 
Snow, is soft gooey cold and frozen water. It is not wet. While walking on snow and enjoying the snow fall, you do not realise how wet you have become. When the snow melts, everything : - your clothes, bag, shoes etc becomes drenched.
This also makes ot very easy to play with the snow, wihtout realising the frost bites it may cause you later on.

## 3. Wear contacts
If you are a person with not-so-perfect vision, wear contact lenses rather than specs. As you walk around in that cold temperature fallng short of oxygen, specticales usually get foggy. They also get frosty easily if something falls and gets wet and are dificult to clean.

## 4. Mind your head
Trees in snowly region are usually shaped in manner to shed off the accumalated snow. rooftops are also angular in structure to allow the snow to fall off. So, long after the snow fall, you need to mind your head while walking, as big rocks of snow can fall on your head any time.
If the sky clears, then these would be dripping down as water.

## 5. Transportation
It is NOT EASY o find a commute during snow. Not all cars are equiped and can handle the wet slippery roads , especially in slopy or mountainous terrain. Depending upon the inches of snow in your region,  many places are at lockdown.

## 6. Power
Just as with any heavy rainfall, there is a high chance of power failure, tree fallling, buildings collapting and other side effects. Depending upon the area you are planning to visit, you need to be prepared. 

## 7.Snowboots
You NEED to rent a pair of snowboots. Snowboots are thick and water proof. They protect your socks from being wet and make it easier for you to walk on ice. Without the snowboots, you feet, socks and shoes will get wet before you even noticing.

## 8. Keep yourself warm.
Needless to say it is going to be COLD. FREEZING COLD. And many tourist, especially who come from coast or pleasent areas don't realy realise what cold means and they find it very difficult to cope. So be prepared and do anything to keep yourself warm.
