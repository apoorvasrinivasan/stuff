3 years ago I thought,  
life was just a continuous function.  
Until I found a goto statement  
and landed at the Rajguru junction.  

The call was perhaps required  
to blendTrans many changes.  
I was once a boolean variable,  
now I am array of different ranges.  

M not a poet and n I don't claim to be.  
Its just a 4KB tribute to u from me.  
It has no rhyming scheme or poetic essence  
and the Grammar used is purely Context Free  

But I hope u'l still treasure it  
somewhere in your vector subspace  
n re-live the Moments Generated  
in this blood sucking place.  

Wonder what attributes our classes contain?!?!  
confused students, teachers insane:  
thinking throughout the semester,  
"WILL I EVER USE THIS CRAP AGAIN????"  

photostats, assignments, songs and messages  
were always in a deadlock  
spent classes yawing, eating  
and looking the Big O' clock  

Tolerating all our Gloria Mundi  
just for an attendance score  
Sorry ma'am, but STATS classes  
were seriously a BORE  

During test, together we sat  
without any shame...  
coz conventionally, the ones  
along the row... win the Game  

Computer Lab Down is place where  
smuggled in pd,food n belongings..  
& we were religiously taught how to  
correct the errors but ignore the warnings!!  

Normalizing our broken chairs.  
Undue work piled up in cache.  
Try to enter in the 11th hr  
Ohh!!..u r turned out.... $$-bash  

We r simply overloaded and overridden  
with tests n assignments but no hols are given  
and still the teachers fail to understand  
why our marks aren't so grand  

These 6 sems, a lot they taught:-  
Strengthen the friendship after huge fught fought  
How to smile even if u flunk  
N the pleasure of coming on a MASS BUNK  

Did all our sharing n caring  
with limited print out sheets  
and tuned our TIME_WAIT states  
with the amazing dhol beats  

Our diverse talents has surely made our colg proud  
be it studying hard or hardly or dancing along with the crowd  
Every aspect of our talent has enthusiastically been presented  
No matter how much, CS has been neglected...  

Ms Fresher, Ms Tapori n Spark of the Day..  
certs too have a huge collection  
and helping each other on exam eve  
without any if-else condition  

Together all of us have taken  
computers to a new Branch.  
This what exactly is called  
a perfect Tech MÃ©lange  

Now the clocks have ticked,  
n its time for us to part  
I bid u all farewell  
with a heavy heart  

I wish u great, wherever u go.  
Strengthen ur assets & set ur debentures low.  
Differentiate the hurdles that come your way  
& remember, client becomes a server someday  

Soon we'll diverge, in the world, we'll diffuse  
so lets empty our stacks, n clear our queues  
if at all we collide in future near or far  
it'll b purely coz of our implicit reference power...  

Let's share the last chilly aloo n andar wali chai
Sort the indifferences, smile and say good-bye  
Not just a degree, but lot of memories I shall take  
I'l now terminate bugging u guys.. Control + Pause Break
