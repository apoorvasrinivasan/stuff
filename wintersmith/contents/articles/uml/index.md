intro: The subject that made exams miserable
---

Its been a month  
n it seems like a year  
there is a limit to what  
the students can bear :@  

 

m getting bored  
n in no mood to study :  
n my head is spinning  
away like an eddy:o  

 

the set of e-books,  
together, they daun  
the classes terrorize  
and the obzects haunt x-(  

 

Not a word further can  
now go into my head  
this subject has successfully  
turned my processors dead.. /)  

 

this weird stuff  
irritating to the core  
n i say to myself,  
"WHAT  MORE..!!!" B)  

 

booch n waghmare  
have different views  
the  use-cases diagrams  
are actually of no use :(  

 

the Question is :  
what class avg would be??  
just 2 more days and  
we will be free..!!!!!
