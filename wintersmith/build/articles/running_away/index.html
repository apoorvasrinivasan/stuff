<p>Running away from mark sheets, that gave no gain<br>Running away from the place whose memories remain<br>Running away from the bitch who ripped our soul apart<br>dilapidated our soul n made our life hap-hazard<br>i wish i could kill her without leaving a clue…<br>but running away is all i can&nbsp;do..:P:D;)  </p>
<p><span class="caps">MY</span> parents who have protected me for years<br>gave me all the happiness n wiped all my tears…<br>I’ll miss my bro… my..mom.. my..dad..<br>i know u’ll miss me too…, oh! am glad!<br>there’l be no1 to scold.. no one to argue..<br>but running away is all that i can do…&nbsp;:(:(  </p>
<p>not to forget those who were by my side<br>the craazziest people who fight, help n guide<br>we “discuss” matters for hrs n yet can’t decide<br>life without them is a roller coaster ride…:D<br>m leaving open wounds that might not heal<br>Running away from u guys was never a fair deal..&nbsp;:(  </p>
<p>I remember the days… when i could c<br>the spark in your eyes while u look at me<br>your innocent smile in my presence<br>n your hair sticking out like medusa’s serpents<br>your unwanted high attitude n your low iq<br>getting away from u is most sensible thing to do.. :P&nbsp;:P  </p>
