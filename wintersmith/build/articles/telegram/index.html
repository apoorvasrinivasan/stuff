      <h1>Why aren't you on whatsapp ?</h1>
      <p class="date">30. April 2017</p>
      <article class="article">
        <section class="content"><p>Every time I tell anyone I have uninstalled WhatsApp, people wonder why. I type out a long list of features in reply. I am hence writing this to explain why i moved to&nbsp;Telegram.</p>
<hr>
<p>For those who dont know, Telegram is an instant messaging​ service. It allows two or more people to chat. WhatsApp undoubtedly was the first internet based chat service that added contacts from the user’s phone book. Prior to WhatsApp there were other instant messaging services like <span class="caps">MSN</span>, gTalk, yahoo chat, etc. but these all required additional users to be created and invited. WhatsApp was well received and became really popular. But, here is the reason why I left&nbsp;it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>number sharing</strong> : WhatsApp does not work without having to exchange your phone number with anyone you have to interact with. If you are a part of a large group for a trip or a project, then your number is visible to everyone part of that group.Gallery : WhatsApp creates a folder called WhatsApp images and videos and is part of the gallery. Any downloaded media is then gets amongst rest of your personal photos. It gets difficult to not only clean them later, your gallery also seems crowded. Anyone going through some album gets access to the junk downloaded by WhatsApp media . Of Course there is an option to not let media get downloaded but the thumbnail is quite blurred and you do end up clicking on it. Once the image is downloaded, you can delete it, but then it there is no option of re-downloading it&nbsp;<span class="caps">EVER</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>multiple devices</strong> : WhatsApp doesn’t work on multiple devices. One phone number is allowed exactly one WhatsApp account and one phone device. If you change your phone, and install WhatsApp on some other device, the previous app throws&nbsp;error.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>web.whatsapp</strong> : Webwhatsapp is a feature to allow you to access their WhatsApp messenger from web browser. <span class="caps">THEIR</span> MESSENGER. Which means, the device should be up and running with active internet connection for the web to&nbsp;work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Facebook Integration</strong> : Since Facebook purchased WhatsApp, there were rumours user data being compromised and facebook using personal phone and contacts data to recommend friends on facebook. Although I don’t even have an <span class="caps">FB</span> account, this still seemed a little breach of privacy. This is also an problem since many of us maintaing two different set of friends and image over facebook and&nbsp;WhatsApp.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-i-love-telegram">Why i love&nbsp;Telegram</h2>
<p>Lets start with how telegram covers up for these&nbsp;drawbacks.</p>
<h3 id="number-sharing">Number&nbsp;sharing</h3>
<p>Telegram works on an username basis. You can set your username. Anyone can chat with you by searching for you by your username. yes, this does allow random unknown people to chat, but responding to them is up to you, and you can always block the annoying ones.You can be a part of as many groups , only people in your contacts will be able to see your phone number. People do not need your number to add you to&nbsp;groups.</p>
<h3 id="gallery">Gallery</h3>
<p>Telegram does not download media in the gallery. You can select the photos and click on <code>save to device</code> and only those would appear in the gallery. Rest of the media is saved in <code>/storage/telegram</code> and can be cleaned whenever phone memory gets full.media never gets deleted : If you click on a media and delete it , you can click on it again and it will get downloaded again. The shared media tab stores the history of shared media amongst the people or the group. Deleted media would have a blurred thumbnail and would get downloaded again from the source on&nbsp;clicking.</p>
<h3 id="devices">Devices</h3>
<p>Telegram app can be installed in as many devices as you like. The details of active sessions can be viewed from the settings menu.Telegram also offers desktop apps and web telegram. Every session runs independent of each other and does not require the phone device to be even switched on. It is very convenient to access and chat while doing other work.It will send a pass code for the initial set up which can be received over <span class="caps">SMS</span> or any other telegram&nbsp;instance.</p>
<h3 id="other-exciting-features">Other exciting&nbsp;features</h3>
<p>Apart from the above, telegram has really exciting features that glues people to&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="stickers">Stickers</h3>
<p>Chatting is all about conveying emotions and one emoji can have multiple interpretations. Telegram allows stickers and sticker packs to display exactly the feeling you wish to convey. Any one can create their own sticker packs with their custom images or choose from a variety of&nbsp;packs</p>
<h3 id="chatting">Chatting</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deleting chats</strong> This is my personal favourite feature of telegram . It allows the sent and delivered messages to be deleted. Even in case of groups, the sent message can be deleted for all the members of the group without a trace. Read messages would also get&nbsp;deleted.</li>
<li><strong>editing</strong> Sent messages can be edited. any spelling mistake can be corrected easily without having to send another message with the corrected&nbsp;text.</li>
<li><strong>code highlight</strong> just like markdown, bold ( ** ) , italics (__) and code (“) works on telegram&nbsp;chats.</li>
<li><strong>Draft</strong> Telegram saves unsent messages as drafts. This draft is synced with all active telegram&nbsp;sessions.</li>
<li><strong>auto preview</strong> It previews any link sent. These links can be later accessed under the shared links&nbsp;tab.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dp-editing"><span class="caps">DP</span>&nbsp;Editing</h3>
<p>Telegram allows you to completely edit your profile picture before posting. This includes cropping, brightness, contrast etc. It also saves the history of all the profile pictures that you have&nbsp;posted.</p>
<h3 id="secret-chats">Secret&nbsp;Chats</h3>
<p>it is for app only timer can be set and messages in a secret chat will get destructed from both&nbsp;ends.</p>
<h3 id="app-lock">app&nbsp;lock</h3>
<p>Telegram apps can have an extra layer of security pass&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3 id="bots"><span class="caps">BOTS</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>gifs bot</strong> 
like stickers , telegram also has gif bot . Just type <code>@gif &lt;query&gt;</code> and you will get a list of amazing funny gifs to&nbsp;share.</li>
<li><strong>Inline Games</strong> 
Allows you to play games like tic tac toe and rock paper scissors with your friends. Just type <code>@inlinegamesbot</code> and choose a&nbsp;game</li>
<li><strong>Open source</strong>
Telegram has bot APIs which allows users to code and share their own bots like github bot, game bot, gif bot etc. You can add any game bot as a member of any group and start playing with your&nbsp;friends!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but-no-one-is-here">but no one is&nbsp;here</h2>
<p>The one response I get when I say all these to people, it that “not all people are there”. I hope this helps your friends to migrate as well&nbsp;:)</p>
