      <h1>30 idiots.. 1 class...and many more f*** ups</h1>
      <p class="date">22. February 2010</p>
      <article class="article">
        <section class="content"><p>3 years ago I thought,<br>life was just a continuous function.<br>Until I found a goto statement<br>and landed at the Rajguru&nbsp;junction.  </p>
<p>The call was perhaps required<br>to blendTrans many changes.<br>I was once a boolean variable,<br>now I am array of different&nbsp;ranges.  </p>
<p>M not a poet and n I don’t claim to be.<br>Its just a <span class="caps">4KB</span> tribute to u from me.<br>It has no rhyming scheme or poetic essence<br>and the Grammar used is purely Context&nbsp;Free  </p>
<p>But I hope u’l still treasure it<br>somewhere in your vector subspace<br>n re-live the Moments Generated<br>in this blood sucking&nbsp;place.  </p>
<p>Wonder what attributes our classes contain?!?!<br>confused students, teachers insane:<br>thinking throughout the semester,<br>“<span class="caps">WILL</span> I EVER USE THIS CRAP&nbsp;AGAIN????”  </p>
<p>photostats, assignments, songs and messages<br>were always in a deadlock<br>spent classes yawing, eating<br>and looking the Big O’&nbsp;clock  </p>
<p>Tolerating all our Gloria Mundi<br>just for an attendance score<br>Sorry ma’am, but <span class="caps">STATS</span> classes<br>were seriously a&nbsp;<span class="caps">BORE</span>  </p>
<p>During test, together we sat<br>without any shame…<br>coz conventionally, the ones<br>along the row… win the&nbsp;Game  </p>
<p>Computer Lab Down is place where<br>smuggled in pd,food n belongings..<br>&amp; we were religiously taught how to<br>correct the errors but ignore the&nbsp;warnings!!  </p>
<p>Normalizing our broken chairs.<br>Undue work piled up in cache.<br>Try to enter in the 11<span class="ord">th</span> hr<br>Ohh!!..u r turned out….&nbsp;$$-bash  </p>
<p>We r simply overloaded and overridden<br>with tests n assignments but no hols are given<br>and still the teachers fail to understand<br>why our marks aren’t so&nbsp;grand  </p>
<p>These 6 sems, a lot they taught:-<br>Strengthen the friendship after huge fught fought<br>How to smile even if u flunk<br>N the pleasure of coming on a <span class="caps">MASS</span>&nbsp;BUNK  </p>
<p>Did all our sharing n caring<br>with limited print out sheets<br>and tuned our TIME_WAIT states<br>with the amazing dhol&nbsp;beats  </p>
<p>Our diverse talents has surely made our colg proud<br>be it studying hard or hardly or dancing along with the crowd<br>Every aspect of our talent has enthusiastically been presented<br>No matter how much, <span class="caps">CS</span> has been&nbsp;neglected…  </p>
<p>Ms Fresher, Ms Tapori n Spark of the Day..<br>certs too have a huge collection<br>and helping each other on exam eve<br>without any if-else&nbsp;condition  </p>
<p>Together all of us have taken<br>computers to a new Branch.<br>This what exactly is called<br>a perfect Tech&nbsp;Mélange  </p>
<p>Now the clocks have ticked,<br>n its time for us to part<br>I bid u all farewell<br>with a heavy&nbsp;heart  </p>
<p>I wish u great, wherever u go.<br>Strengthen ur assets <span class="amp">&amp;</span> set ur debentures low.<br>Differentiate the hurdles that come your way<br>&amp; remember, client becomes a server&nbsp;someday  </p>
<p>Soon we’ll diverge, in the world, we’ll diffuse<br>so lets empty our stacks, n clear our queues<br>if at all we collide in future near or far<br>it’ll b purely coz of our implicit reference&nbsp;power…  </p>
<p>Let’s share the last chilly aloo n andar wali chai
Sort the indifferences, smile and say good-bye<br>Not just a degree, but lot of memories I shall take<br>I’l now terminate bugging u guys.. Control + Pause&nbsp;Break  </p>
